Hi, I am Parth and you can find out more about me [here](https://parthdhar.me/about.html). I plan to use Slakox to publish whatever comes to mind: these might be useful "lifehax" or just angry rants. Consider [subscribing](http://parthdhar.me/blog/feed.xml) if you'd like to stick around.

About the name, Slakox is a silly portmanteau of slacking off and [Snorlax](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Snorlax_(Pok%C3%A9mon)): the two things I identify the most with.
